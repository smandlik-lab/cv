SOLID => 

Need to Explain in SIOLD sequence

SRP - "A class should have only 1 reason to chagne" 
        EX.
        User- Register | Login | Logging (Info, Error etc.) | Send Email Notification

ISP - 1. "Class should not be forced to implement any method they don't use"
      2. "Instead of creating fat Interface, create multiple smaller interface"
      EX.
      1. HPLaserJetPrinter -> Scan,Print,FAX,PrintDuplex
      2. LiquidInkJetPrinter -> Scan, Print

OCP  (Most Important Principle)- 
    "A software entities such as modules, classes, functions, etc. should be open for extention,"
      "but closed for modification"
      Implementation Guideline 
        1. "Simplest way to apply OCP is to implement the new functionality on new derived classes."
        2. "Allow clients to access the original class with absctract interface."

        EX.
        Employee -> 
        1. PermanentEmployee - Salary Calculation with Bonus
        2. TemparoryEmployee - Salary Calculation with bonus 

    // using abstract calss OCP can be achieve
        
LSP "Derived types must be completely substitutable for their base types"
"New requirment like"

"Extentsion of the" Open Close Principle

        Implementation Guideline 
        1. "No new exception can be thrown by the subtype"
        2. 
        
        EX.
        1. PermanentEmployee
        2. TemparoryEmployee
        3. ContractEmployee        

DIP - Dependency Inversion Principle.

        1. "High-level modules/classes should not depend on low-level modules/classes."
         "Both should be depends on abstraction"
        2. "Abstraction should not depend on details,
                'Details shuld be depend on Abstraction".
        EX. - Repository implementation
        1. Adapter Design Pattern.
